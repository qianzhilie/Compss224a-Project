## Project Overview

San Mateo County, a thriving yet increasingly inaccessible region in the Bay Area, is facing a deepening housing crisis characterized by soaring rents, a shortage of affordable housing, and significant financial strain on renters. This study examines the shifting dynamics of housing affordability and population movement over the past decade, exploring how economic and demographic changes have influenced residential stability.

Through historical trend analysis, spatial mapping, and causal inference techniques, we investigate two primary research questions:

1. How have rent burden and geographical mobility in San Mateo County changed over time?

2. To what extent has geographical mobility affected rent burden in San Mateo County over time?

Our findings highlight the increasing tension between affordability constraints and demographic shifts, revealing that lower-income and immigrant communities experience disproportionate levels of mobility. Additionally, extreme rent burdens are strongly associated with increased relocation, particularly over greater distances.

By leveraging data-driven methodologies, this research offers valuable insights into the forces driving housing instability in San Mateo County and provides a foundation for policies aimed at reducing displacement, enhancing affordability, and supporting long-term community resilience.

## Methodology

- Historical Trend Analysis: Examines changes in rent burden and mobility over time.

- Spatial Mapping: Visualizes geographic distribution of affordability and movement patterns.

- Causal Inference Techniques: Identifies the impact of mobility on rent burden.
