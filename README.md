Project Overview

San Mateo County is experiencing a growing housing crisis, with rising rents, affordability challenges, and increasing financial strain on renters. This study explores the relationship between rent burden and population movement over the past decade. Using historical trend analysis, spatial mapping, and causal inference techniques, we examine how economic and demographic shifts impact residential stability and mobility patterns.

Methodology

Historical Trend Analysis: Examines changes in rent burden and mobility over time.

Spatial Mapping: Visualizes geographic distribution of affordability and movement patterns.

Causal Inference Techniques: Identifies the impact of mobility on rent burden.
